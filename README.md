## BYOP — Bring Your Own Pollen

NovAI uses the [Pollinations device flow](https://enter.pollinations.ai) to let users authorize with their own account. When a user runs `/connect`, NovAI provides a short code to enter at `enter.pollinations.ai/device`. Once authorized, their own Pollen credits cover their usage — the server owner's credits are never touched.
